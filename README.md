# csc_455_P2
A small project I completed for CSC 455 (Social Computing at NC State). Just puting it somewhere.
The project consisists of two guided Jupyter notebooks (my code exists in the [mesa_test](P2/mesa_test.ipynb) and [CSC_455_555_P2](P2/CSC_455_555_P2.ipynb) notebooks, while the two corresponding files in the [ipynb_checkpoints folder](P2/ipynb_checkpoints) show the professor's examples of utilyzing the library) utilizing the Mesa library to model interactions of independent agents.

The [mesa_test](P2/mesa_test.ipynb) file contains code to create and run a very simplified model of a small economy in which all models begin with a wealth unit of 1, and have the option to give a wealth unit away to another agent in thier same cell on a 2-dimensional grid after moving to an adjacent space on that grid. After running the model, a Gini coefficient is calculated on the population, which always ends up tending towards around .7 as steps continue.
